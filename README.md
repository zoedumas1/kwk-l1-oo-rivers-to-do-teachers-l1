### River Classes

You've learned about creating classes to imitate objects in the real world. Let's put that knowledge to the test by making a `River` class.

Rivers have a name (that should be set at initialization). A river also has a length, countries that it flows through, and discharge (in cubic meters per second.) Set these attributes using writer methods.

A river also has a few actions. `flood` should increase the discharge by 30%. `dry_up` should decrease the discharge by 50%.

Create the `River` class based on this data and then create instances of the class for the following rivers (using your awesome Wikipedia skills):

+ The Nile

+ The Mississippi

+ The Amazon

+ The Seine

+ The Yangtze

+ The Euphrates

The Amazon and the Yangtze should flood. The Euphrates should dry up.
